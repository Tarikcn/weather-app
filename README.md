# Weather App Dashboard

## Description

Server APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS, the app will have access to Server APIs and retrieve weather data by using the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities.
We will use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## Technologies Used

- Bootstrap
- JQuery
- Moment .JS
